            <li> On this project, this was my first one with was a little more indepth than the basic website I made.  This one, included embedded images, and links to other websites.  For someone who couldn't do this few days prior to making this, I'm pretty proud of myself.</li>

            <li> Have to admit, I had a very talented partner to do this.  But, I did have a ton of input on how to make it, and how it should look.  What I was most impressed about is helping in making the sidebar, which was very impressive, even to my classmates.  We didn't get to finish obviously, but with a little more time, I believe we couldve recreated this page, no problem.</li>
