    <center><h1>I word hard, and play harder</h1></center>
    <p>
    <center>I try to enjoy life as much as possible, and it's so much better when you have great people to enjoy it with.  Here are some of the things I love to do:</center>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="well">
      <center><h2>I love my wife</h2></center>
        <center><img src="img/laura.jpg" width="200" height="200"></center>
        <p>We've been together for 8 years, and married for 2.  She's my everything, and makes me want to be a better man.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="well">
        <center><h2>The Love of Traveling</h2></center>
        <center><img src="img/beach.jpg" alt="feet on beach" width="200" height="200"><img src="img/car.jpg" width="200" height="200"></center>
        <p>If it's going to the tropical beach, or going on a road trip somewhere close, I love to see new places.  Traveling is one of the things I absolutely love.  Close, or far, I need to see new things.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="well">
        <h2>Raider Nation</h2>
        <center><img src="img/raiders.jpg" width="200" height="200"></center>
        <p>Anyone that knows me, knows I'm a die hard Raider fan.  No, I'm not that one those that dresses up, but pretty damn close.  The one thing hard about living in Seattle is not being able to go to games like I did.  But I don't miss watching a game.  Some may call me crazy...but I just call it being a Raider fan!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="well">
          <h2>Hanging with Friends</h2>
          <center><img src="img/friends.jpg" width="200" height="200"></center>
          <p>Next to binging a show with my wife, or going traveling with her, I love hanging with my friends.  Yes, they're douchbags, but they're my douchebags.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="well">
          <h2>Fun Times</h2>
          <center><img src="img/fun.jpg" width="200" height="200"></center>
          <p>Anyone that knows me, understands that having fun is key.  Stop taking life so seriously.  Yes, there are things that need to be taken seriously, and act accordingly.  But when the time come to let loose, I will take full advantage of it.</p>
